# Wikipedia-Article-Generator
An article generator that allows the user to quickly surf through articles and read about or open the ones they are interested in.
The official wikipedia page generator is cool, but I wanted something that would also give summaries and allow you to rapidly cycle topics until you found one you were interested in, 
so I made one.
